CDI (Cloud Digital Interface) SDK Version 2.3.0 - 08/30/21
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New
------------

* When creating connections, added ability to share a single poll thread across multiple connections. This can be
  used to reduce CPU core usage. The thread must have enough bandwidth to service all connections associated with it.
   * See shared_thread_id, which has been added to the CdiTxConfigData and CdiRxConfigData structures. NOTE: Use zero or
     a negative value (ie. -1) to disable this feature and create a unique poll thread that is associated only with the
     connection being created.
   * Added new command line options to the cdi_test application. See "-tc" or "--thread_conn".
   * When using more than 6 multiple connections, depending on payload size and available memory, you may have to reduce
     the size defined by MAX_RX_PACKETS_PER_CONNECTION. For Linux, you can also increase the number of available
     hugepages from a default value of 1024 by modifying /etc/sysctl.conf to contain 2048 or higher as shown below. Must
     then use "sudo sysctl -p".
     vm.nr_hugepages = 2048

Bug Fixes
------------
* Removed macro NANOSECONDS_PER_SECOND from header cdi_utility_api.h.
* Added prefix CDI_ or Cdi to various macros and symbols in headers cdi_utility_api.h, cdi_core_api.h, cdi_logger_api.h,
  cdi_queue_api.h, and cdi_test_unit_api.h.
* Updated code for AVM baseline profiles to match published specifications concerning use of semicolons. The values
  generated by CdiAvmMakeBaselineConfiguration() for video width and height were separated by a comma instead of a
  semicolon. For example: "width=1920, height=1080;" will now be generated as "width=1920; height=1080;".
* Updated code for GetAvmBaselineUnitSize() which was reporting incorrect unit sizes for audio and ancillary media
  profiles. In previous versions GetAvmBaselineUnitSize() returned the number of bytes instead of the number of bits.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDI (Cloud Digital Interface) SDK Version 2.2.0 - 05/19/2021
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New
------------

* Changed protocol version to 2.1 (CDI_PROTOCOL_VERSION.CDI_PROTOCOL_MAJOR_VERSION) and added new probe protocol
  version 4 (CDI_PROBE_VERSION) to support bidirectional sockets used by probe control interface.
* Added new OS APIs for sockets. See CdiOsSocketGetSockAddrIn(), CdiOsSocketReadFrom() and CdiOsSocketWriteTo().
* Using bidirectional sockets for the out-of-band probe control interface. A single socket is used for each
  connection. Compatibility with previous versions of the probe control interface is maintained.
* Added "CDI_" prefix to defines and types in cdi_os_api.h to prevent name collisions with application code.
* Added support for AVM connections that contain multiple endpoints. They can be used to demux and mux video, audio and
  ancillary data streams. Changes include:
   * New documentation and diagrams. See include/cdi_avm_api.h.
   * New AVM APIs. See CdiAvmTxStreamConnectionCreate(), CdiAvmTxStreamEndpointCreate() and CdiAvmEndpointTxPayload().
   * Removed stream_identifier from CdiTxConfigDataStream structure. See include/cdi_avm_api.h.
   * Removed stream_identifier from CdiCoreConnectionCbData structure. Added remote_ip_str and remote_dest_port. See
     include/cdi_core_api.h.
   * Added new command line options to the cdi_test application. See "-XS" or "--new_conns".
* Added payload transfer start time. It is available in the CdiAvmRxCbData/CdiRawRxCbData structure parameter passed to
  the Rx payload application callbacks. See CdiCoreCbData, tx_start_time_microseconds in include/cdi_core_api.h.
* Added new CdiCoreNetworkAdapterDestroy() API. This allows dynamic destruction of resources created by
  CdiCoreNetworkAdapterInitialize(). Before using CdiCoreNetworkAdapterDestroy(), must ensure all connections using the
  adapter are closed. See CdiCoreConnectionDestroy(). Also, all connections and adapters must be closed/destroyed before
  using CdiCoreShutdown().
* Added internal reference count to Logger state data. NOTE: Each time CdiLoggerInitialize() is called,
  CdiLoggerShutdown() must be called once. The test applications have been updated to call CdiLoggerShutdown().
* Added support for additional internal transport layer protocols. See new types/APIs in cdi/src/protocol.h.
   * Protocol version has been added to the application connection callback data. See negotiated_... in
     CdiCoreConnectionCbData in include/cdi_core_api.h.
   * CDI_PROTOCOL_MAJOR_VERSION has been replaced with CDI_PROBE_VERSION.
   * Supports previous protocol/probe version. See cdi/src/protocol_v1.c.
   * New protocol/probe version 2.0.3. Contains the new probe command kProbeStateSendProtocolVersion, used to negotiate
     a compatible version between local and remote endpoints. Protocol and probe data structure differences are
     described in cdi/src/protocol_v2.c.
* Fixed two values in video baseline profile for TCS ("ST2065-1", "ST428-1") and colorimetry ("ST2065-1", "ST2065-3")
  that improperly had underscores rather than hyphens. This change brings the implementation in line with the
  specifications (ST 2110-20, -30). A calculated risk assessment has been made to not follow the normal process of
  incrementing the API version number. While this does introduce an unhandled incompatibility, the likelihood of this
  affecting actual workflows was deemed to be insignificant.

Bug Fixes
------------

* Fixed problems with multiple calls to CdiCoreInitialize(). See https://github.com/aws/aws-cdi-sdk/issues/34

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDI (Cloud Digital Interface) SDK Version 2.0.2 - 01/08/2021
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New
------------

* Added initial version of the SDK coding style guide. See CODE_STYLE_GUIDE.md.
* Replaced CdiLoggerSetGlobalLog() API with new CdiLogGlobalGet() API, which returns the global log handle created
  via CdiCoreInitialize() API. The deprecated API did not serve any functional purpose.
* Added Windows targets for generating DLLs for the CDI-AWS SDK library. See use of Debug_DLL and Release_DLL in the
  Visual Studio solution and project files. Details at: https://github.com/aws/aws-cdi-sdk/pull/26
* Added use of the CDI_INTERFACE define to APIs that were not previously using it. Only affects the new Windows DLL
  targets.
* When using CdiOsMemAllocHugePage() API on Linux, the size of bytes allocated must be a multiple of
  CDI_HUGE_PAGES_BYTE_SIZE. See definition in cdi_os_api.h. If not, the memory will not be freed when using the
  CdiOsMemFreeHugePage() API.
* Renamed the queue type kQueueMultipleWriters to kQueueMultipleWritersFlag to clarify that the value is a flag,
  not an OS signal type. See include/cdi_queue_api.h.
* Added defines to uniquely identify the CDI transport protocol used by the SDK. See the CDI_PROTOCOL_VERSION,
  CDI_PROTOCOL_MAJOR_VERSION and CDI_PROTOCOL_MINOR_VERSION in include/cdi_core_api.h.

Bug Fixes
------------

* Fixed a problem in RxPollFreeBuffer() that could lead to an assert (segfault in debug build) in CdiListRemove() when
  trying to remove an entry from an empty list.
* Fixed a Rx adapter buffer memory leak when using the CdiCoreRxFreeBuffer() API from multiple threads.
* Fixed a segfault when using the CdiLoggerMultilineEnd() API from multiple threads.
* Fixed a segfault in the Windows variant when logging to stdout and stdout did not exist. The global logger created
  via CdiCoreInitialize() API is now used instead of stdout. Details at: https://github.com/aws/aws-cdi-sdk/pull/25
* Fixed problem with Linux Makefile that could cause the AWS-SDK to always partially re-build on Linux.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDI (Cloud Digital Interface) SDK Version 2.0.0 - 12/14/2020
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New
------------
* Documentation updates.
* Added support for additional AVM baseline profiles. See new types/APIs in include/baseline_profile_api.h.
* Added AVM Baseline profile 2.00.
* Added configuration settings to the following structures:
   * CdiTxConfigData: Added max_simultaneous_tx_payloads and max_simultaneous_tx_payload_sgl_entries.
   * CdiRxConfigData: Added max_simultaneous_rx_payloads_per_connection.
   These settings were previously statically defined. To use the static values, set these to zero. NOTE. Use memset or a
   zero structure initializer (= {0}) to set the whole structure to zero before setting the desired members to the
   actual values required.
* Added new core utility APIs for getting TAI time. See CdiCoreGetPtpTimestamp() and CdiCoreGetTaiTimeMicroseconds().
* Added new OS types and APIs for using statically allocated mutexes. See CdiStaticMutexType,
  CDI_STATIC_MUTEX_INITIALIZER, CdiOsStaticMutexLock() and CdiOsStaticMutexUnlock().
* Added new OS portable type for use by the CdiOsSocket...() APIs to hold socket instance data (ie. port number). This
  was done so the transmit side socket no longer has to call connect(), thus preventing failed sends due to ICMP port
  unreachable responses. See CdiSocket.
* Moved the Logger to the public API. Header file is located at include/cdi_logger_api.h.
* Moved the Queue to the public API. Header file is located at include/cdi_queue_api.h. Also, added support for multiple
  writers. See the new types kQueueSignalModeMask and kQueueMultipleWriters.
* Added new OS portable type for converting between nanoseconds and seconds. See NANOSECONDS_PER_SECOND.
* Added number of bytes transferred to statistics. See num_bytes_transferred in cdi_core_api.h and BytesTransferred in
  cloudwatch_sdk_metrics.cpp.

Bug Fixes
------------
* Several connection related issues and segfaults as described in published GitHub issues.
